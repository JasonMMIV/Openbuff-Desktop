# Reviewer subsystem — design proposals

Status: Proposal A IMPLEMENTED (via `scripts/generate-gate-helpers.ts` +
freshness test); Proposal B IMPLEMENTED (merge ledger via
`mergeReviewerFindings` on security + final code-reviewer blocking paths,
keeping the existing arrays rather than a second keyed field); Proposal C
already IMPLEMENTED (aux-ownership variant — see below). Three safe fixes were
shipped earlier (see "Already shipped" below).

Source of truth at time of writing: `agents/base2/base2.ts` (the serialized
`createBase2` `handleSteps` generator), `agents/base2/gate-state.ts`,
`agents/base2/gate-reviewer.ts`, `agents/base2/gate-paths.ts`,
`agents/base2/gate-repair.ts`, and their parity tests under
`agents/__tests__/`.

## Already shipped (context)

- **Removed dead `staticReviewOnly` scaffolding.** The flag, `staticReviewerJobId`,
  the guarded `check_background_agent { cancel: true }` blocks, the
  `= undefined` resets, and the field-only round-trip tests were deleted. The
  reviewer was never actually spawned with `background: true`, so no reviewer
  ever ran concurrently with validation; enabling the flag did nothing. This
  was pure cleanup.
- **Recorded specialist reviewer provenance.** `openReviewerFindings[].reviewer`
  was widened to `'code-reviewer' | 'security-reviewer' | SpecialistReviewerAgent`
  and the specialist blocking path now stamps `reviewer: agentType`. This
  provenance is now what drives Proposal C's aux-ownership routing.
- **Implemented Proposal C (aux-ownership variant).** `requiredReviewerRevalidation`
  was widened to hold a `SpecialistReviewerAgent`, and an inline
  `revalidationFamily` classifier routes each family's revalidation back to the
  aux block that already owns its correct attestation contract: security ->
  security aux block (params `changed_files`+`snapshot_fingerprint`), specialist
  -> specialist aux block (fresh `get_change_review_bundle` `snapshot_id` +
  one-refresh retry), code -> final block. Fire-guards are family-scoped and
  marker clears never clobber another family's marker. This also FIXED a latent
  bug: security-reviewer revalidation previously flowed into the paramless final
  spawn, which could never satisfy security-reviewer's required params. See the
  aux-ownership note appended to Proposal C below.

## Proposal A — Reduce `gate-reviewer.ts` / inline parity duplication

### Problem

The reviewer-gate helpers exist twice:

1. As clean, testable module exports in `agents/base2/gate-reviewer.ts`
   (`collectReviewerBlockers`, `getReviewerFinalizationVerdict`,
   `detectReviewerCrash`, `collectStructuredReviewerOutputs`,
   `collectReviewerAttestationIssues`, `stripReviewerPreamble`,
   `isTestCoverageReviewerFinding`, ...).
2. As inline copies inside the `createBase2` `handleSteps` generator body
   (`collectReviewerFindingRecordsInline`, `selectSpecialistReviewersInline`,
   and the inline verdict/blocker/attestation helpers).

Root cause (documented in `gate-reviewer.ts`'s header comment): `handleSteps`
is serialized with `handleSteps.toString()` and reconstructed via
`new Function(...)`. Reconstructed functions lose their module closure, so the
generator cannot reference imports from `gate-reviewer.ts` at runtime.
Everything the generator calls must be defined inline in the body.

Current mitigation: parity tests (`gate-reviewer-parity.test.ts`,
`gate-paths-parity.test.ts`, `gate-repair-parity.test.ts`) use
`extractInlineFunctionSource` / `loadInline*Helpers` to pull each inline copy
out of the serialized generator and assert byte/behavior equivalence with the
exported version. Drift is *detected*, not *prevented*, and the extraction is
fragile (it string-parses the generator body).

### Options

- **A1 — Build-step inlining (single source of truth).** Keep only the
  `gate-reviewer.ts` module. Add a prebuild step that mechanically injects the
  helper sources into the generator body (or emits a generated file that the
  generator references) before `handleSteps.toString()` serialization runs.
  The parity tests are replaced by a "generated block is fresh" check
  (same pattern as `cli/src/agents/bundled-agents.generated.ts` freshness).
  - Pros: one source of truth; drift becomes impossible rather than detected.
  - Cons: adds generator complexity; must run before the existing
    `cli/scripts/prebuild-agents.ts` bundling; another generated artifact to
    keep fresh in CI.
- **A2 — Serializable helper injection.** Pass the helpers into the generator
  through a mechanism that survives `new Function` (e.g. stringify named helper
  sources into a preamble the generator evals once). Fights the execution
  model; high risk. Not recommended.
- **A3 — Keep parity tests, harden extraction.** Lowest effort: leave the two
  copies, but make `extractInlineFunctionSource` more robust and add a lint that
  fails when a `gate-reviewer.ts` export lacks a matching parity test.
  - Pros: minimal, no execution-model risk.
  - Cons: still two sources of truth; still a maintenance tax.

### Recommendation

A1 if we are willing to invest in the prebuild step (it is the only option that
actually eliminates the duplication the user flagged). A3 as the low-risk
fallback if we want to keep the change small. A2 is not recommended.

### Risk / blast radius

High. `base2.ts` is the gate. Any inlining bug changes review verdict parsing
for every edit turn. Must land behind the full gate + parity/`base2.test.ts` /
e2e suites, and the generated bundle must be regenerated.

## Proposal B — Merged multi-reviewer finding ledger (single-slot -> keyed)

### Problem

`activeWorkState.openReviewerBlockers` / `openReviewerFindings` are a single
slot. Whichever tier blocks last wins: the security gate sets them, a specialist
gate can overwrite them, and the final code-reviewer overwrites them again.
Today this is safe ONLY because the tiers are strictly sequential and each
blocking tier `continue`s or `break`s the loop before the next tier runs — so
exactly one tier's findings are ever "live" at once. There is no place that
merges findings from multiple reviewers.

### Why it is worth changing

- If tiers ever run concurrently (e.g. a future real static-review path), the
  single slot becomes a lost-update race.
- Operators only ever see one tier's findings at a time; a change that is both a
  security risk and a reliability risk surfaces only the last-writing tier.
- Repair routing has to reconstruct provenance (partially addressed by the
  shipped provenance metadata).

### Proposed shape

Replace the single slot with a keyed ledger on the gate state:

```ts
openReviewerFindingsByGate?: Record<string /* gateId */, {
  reviewer: 'code-reviewer' | 'security-reviewer' | SpecialistReviewerAgent
  snapshotFingerprint: string
  findings: OpenReviewerFinding[]
  status: 'open' | 'resolved'
}>
```

- Derive the flat `openReviewerBlockers` (still consumed by pinning/messaging
  and `buildPinnedActiveWorkMessage`) as a computed projection over all `open`
  ledger entries, so the user-visible contract is unchanged.
- Each tier writes/updates only its own keyed entry; clearing a finding marks
  that entry `resolved` instead of blowing away the whole slot.
- The gate passes only when every ledger entry is `resolved`.

### Migration / compatibility

- Backward-compatible: older serialized state lacks the field -> treat as the
  legacy single-slot behavior (fail closed).
- `context-pruner.ts` reads `openReviewerBlockers`; keep that field as the
  derived projection so the pruner and gate-state block are unaffected.
- Parity: the ledger logic lives inline in the generator, so it needs the same
  parity-test treatment as Proposal A (another argument for doing A first).

### Risk

Medium-high. Changes the core block/clear bookkeeping. Must preserve exact
finalization semantics (gate passes iff no open findings) and the pinned
`<gate-state>` contract.

## Proposal C — Specialist / security revalidation routing (the Q2 behavior change)

### Why this is NOT a small fix

The Q2 request was "route revalidation back to that specialist." Verification
shows the final-reviewer block cannot do this as-is:

- `base2.ts:2307`: `requiredReviewerAgentType = requiredReviewerRevalidation ?? 'code-reviewer'`.
- The final reviewer spawn (`base2.ts:3038`) passes **only a `prompt`** — no
  `params`.
- But `security-reviewer` requires `params.changed_files` + `snapshot_fingerprint`,
  and specialists require `params.snapshot_id`.
- Specialists attest against the `get_change_review_bundle` `snapshotId`, which
  is a DIFFERENT fingerprint than the `reviewSnapshotFingerprint` the final
  block builds/validates against.

So routing a specialist through `requiredReviewerRevalidation` would fail spawn
params AND snapshot attestation. Today specialists effectively "self-revalidate"
by re-running their own gate block on loop re-entry (they `continue` on block
and never set `requiredReviewerRevalidation`). `requiredReviewerRevalidation` is
currently only ever `'security-reviewer'` or `'code-reviewer'`.

### Options

- **C1 — Keep current self-revalidation, do nothing to routing.** The shipped
  provenance metadata already records which specialist found the issue.
  Specialists re-run their own block after repair. Lowest risk; the flagged
  `reviewerOriginFromGateId` reconstruction stays but is now backed by real
  metadata.
- **C2 — Generalize the revalidation dispatcher.** Make the final block
  parameterize the reviewer spawn by agent family: build the correct `params`
  (`snapshot_id` for specialists via a fresh `get_change_review_bundle`,
  `changed_files`+`snapshot_fingerprint` for security, none for code-reviewer)
  and attest against the matching fingerprint per family. Then
  `requiredReviewerRevalidation` can legitimately hold a specialist type.
  - Pros: unified revalidation path; provenance drives routing.
  - Cons: the final block must branch attestation by reviewer family; the
    snapshot-fingerprint mismatch between the specialist bundle id and the
    reviewable-scope fingerprint has to be reconciled. This is the single most
    fragile part of the gate.

### Recommendation

C1 now (already effectively in place; the provenance ship makes it coherent).
Pursue C2 only alongside Proposal A/B, because it touches the same inline gate
logic and needs the same parity + e2e coverage. Do not attempt C2 as a
standalone quick edit.

### Risk

High (C2). Attestation is the anti-clash core of the whole subsystem; a wrong
fingerprint branch would let a review of stale bytes pass.

### IMPLEMENTED (aux-ownership, chosen over C2 dispatch)

Rather than turning the fragile final block into a family-aware dispatcher
(C2), the implemented design keeps each family's attestation in the aux block
that already encodes it correctly:

- `requiredReviewerRevalidation` is now a persisted "revalidation-owed" family
  marker that CAN hold a `SpecialistReviewerAgent`, but it does not drive the
  final-block spawn. An inline `revalidationFamily(marker)` classifier maps the
  marker to `'none' | 'code' | 'security' | 'specialist'`.
- Fire-guards: the security aux block fires when the family is `none` or
  `security`; the specialist aux block fires when the family is `none` or
  `specialist` (re-including the owed specialist and dropping it from
  `specialistReviewGatesDone` so its spawn+attestation re-runs); the final
  block spawns a reviewer only when the family is `none` or `code`.
- Each owner block clears the marker only when it owns that family, so one
  block never clobbers another family's marker. The initial marker inference
  now prefers `openReviewerFindings[0].reviewer` (the shipped provenance) with
  a gateId-prefix fallback, which is how a specialist blocking finding from one
  turn re-fires the specialist aux block on the next.
- This fixed the latent security-reviewer revalidation bug (paramless final
  spawn) as a side effect, since security now always revalidates through its
  params-bearing aux block.

Note: on a blocking specialist finding the specialist aux block parks
`blocked` with the provenance-stamped finding and `continue`s (it does not
spawn repair-editor inline the way the security block does); the marker is
rehydrated to the specialist family at the next turn's setup from that
persisted finding, which is what drives the aux re-fire.

Remaining open: C2's full unified dispatcher is intentionally NOT implemented;
aux-ownership was chosen for lower blast radius on the attestation core.

## Suggested sequencing

1. Proposal A (single source of truth) first — it unblocks safe iteration on the
   inline gate logic that B and C both need.
2. Proposal B (keyed ledger) second — depends on A's parity approach.
3. Proposal C2 (revalidation dispatcher) last — highest risk, reuses A+B
   infrastructure. C1 is the no-op-now default.

Each must land behind: `cd agents && bun run typecheck`, `bun test base2.test.ts`,
the `gate-reviewer` / `gate-*-parity` suites, the `agents/e2e` gate lifecycle +
reviewer-spawn-conditions e2e tests, and a regenerated
`cli/src/agents/bundled-agents.generated.ts`.

## Lessons learned during implementation (2026-08-21)

- **TDZ hazard when hoisting consts inside the serialized generator.** Moving
  `reliabilityCodeStems` / `reliabilityCodeExtension` "above"
  `selectSpecialistReviewersInline` must mean above it AND before every runtime
  call site: `const` bindings initialize only when execution reaches them, and
  `handleSteps` executes top-to-bottom from its opening (~line 554) while the
  first router call site sits at ~line 2199. Placing the hoisted block next to
  the function's declaration site (~line 6667) crashed every gate e2e at
  runtime with `Cannot access 'reliabilityCodeExtension' before
  initialization` even though typecheck and the parity suite stayed green —
  the parity harness rebuilds scope instead of executing the generator, and
  the file-change hooks only typecheck. Rule: any hoisted binding inside
  `handleSteps` goes at the very top of the generator body, keeping the consts
  contiguous with the function so the parity slice keeps working. Only
  executing the full test suite catches this class of bug.
- **Router vocabulary widening couples to test fixtures.** Fixtures chosen
  under old routing rules silently change meaning when vocabulary widens:
  `cli/src/auth/session.ts` began routing reliability-reviewer once exact
  filename stems (`session`) were added, breaking three aux-ordering e2e tests.
  When widening the router, grep e2e fixtures for newly-matching paths and
  prefer fixtures whose basename cannot match any family (e.g.
  `token-store.ts`).
- **Full-suite validation belongs before push, not after.** Both regressions
  above were invisible to focused suites and typecheck; only
  `cd agents && bun test` over all 51 files surfaced them. `check:ci-local`
  now includes the full agents suite as Step E so the pre-push hook and local
  CI mirror catch TDZ-class regressions before they reach origin/main.
